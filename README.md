## How It Works
LangGraph Multi-Agent Design:
input_city â†’ Prompts user to enter the destination city.

input_interest â†’ Collects user interests related to the trip.

create_itinerary â†’ Calls LLaMA 3 via GROQ API to generate a personalized day-trip itinerary.

Each node updates the internal PlannerState and transitions using a directed state graph (StateGraph).



##Example Prompt Flow
User: "I want to plan a day trip"

App: "Which city do you want to visit?"

User: "Bangalore"

App: "What are your interests for this trip?"

User: "nature, food, museums"

App:  Generates a bulleted itinerary with LLaMA 3 via GROQ
